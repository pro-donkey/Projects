    <ul>Bell pepper Bacterial Spot
        <li>Disease symptoms can appear throughout the above-ground portion of the plant, which may include leaf spot, fruit spot
        and stem canker.
        </li>
        <li>Early symptoms show up as water-soaked lesions on leaves that can quickly change from green to dark brown
        and enlarge into spots that are up to 1/4 inch in diameter with slightly raised margins.</li>
        <li>For bacterial leaf spot, the following methods can be used to reduce the survival, spread and reproduction of bacteria
        and to minimize the infection of plants: using resistant varieties, seed treatment, foliage treatment and using an
        integrated strategy.</li>
