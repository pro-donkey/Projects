    <ul>Squash Leaf Curl
        <li>Squash leaf curl vary somewhat with the host species and the developmental stage of the plant at the time of infection.
        Severe losses can occur when plants are infected when young, especially in the seedling stage. Infection of older plants
        later in the season may not have a noticeable impact on yield.</li>
        <li>SLCV survives in infected cucurbit crops and cucurbit weed plants. The virus is transmitted from plant to plant by the
        sweetpotato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and the silverleaf whitefly (B. tabaci, biotype B). No seed transmission has been
        detected for SCLV on cucurbits.</li>
        <li>.Planting transplants rather than direct-seeding usually results in lower yield losses because plants tend to be older
        at
        the time of infection.Growers should plant only virus-free and whitefly-free transplants, and locally produced
        transplant are usually
        preferred.Removing (roguing-out) seedlings showing symptoms of SLCV infection within 30 days after transplanting or
        direct seeding
        can reduce the spread of the virus within the planting. Destroying the crop promptly after the final harvest will also
        eliminate a source of virus and whiteflies for other cucurbit crops in the area.</li>
