    <h1>Diseases of Patato</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>Patato Early Blight
        <li>Early blight is primarily a disease of stressed or senescing plants. Symptoms appear first on the oldest foliage.
        Affected leaves develop circular to angular dark brown lesions 0.12 to 0.16 inch (3–4 mm) in diameter. Concentric rings
        often form in lesions to produce characteristic target-board effect. Severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop.
        Infected tubers show a brown, corky dry rot.
        </li>
        <li>Between crops, the early blight fungus can overwinter on potato refuse in the field, in soil, on tubers, and on other
        solanaceous plants. Infection occurs when spores of the fungus come in contact with susceptible leaves and sufficient
        free moisture is present. Spore germination and infection are favored by warm weather and wet conditions from dew, rain,
        or sprinkler irrigation.</li>
        <li>For bacterial leaf spot, the following methods can be used to reduce the survival, spread and reproduction of bacteria
        and to minimize the infection of plants: using resistant varieties, seed treatment, foliage treatment and using an
        integrated strategy.</li>

    </ul>
        <ul>Patato Late Blight
            <li>Late blight lesions can occur on all aboveground plant parts. On leaves, lesions typically first appear as small pale to
            dark green water-soaked spots that are irregular in shape and surrounded by a zone of yellowish tissue. Under conducive
            conditions, lesions expand rapidly and become brown to purplish black as tissue is killed.
            </li>
            <li>Potato-growing areas its occurrence is sporadic, depending on the presence of the pathogen and cool, damp weather
            conditions. Inoculum of Phytophthora infestans can originate from seed tubers, cull piles, volunteers, closely related
            weed hosts such as nightshade, and adjacent plantings of potatoes or tomatoes that are affected. Late blight can develop
            and spread rapidly if inoculum is present and conditions are conducive. High humidity (above 90%) and average
            temperatures in the range of 50° to 78°F favor the disease.</li>
            <li>Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage
            practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is
            important. Under marginal conditions, overhead sprinkler irrigation can favor late blight.</li>
        
        </ul>
