<h1>Diseases of Grapes</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>Grapes Black Rot
        <li>Black rot, caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii, is a serious disease of cultivated and wild grapes. The disease is most destructive in warm, wet seasons. It attacks all green parts of the vine â€“ leaves, shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit.</li>

    </ul>
    <ul>Grapes Esca
        <li>Curative methods are also used to save esca-infected vines or at least prolong their life. One of these methods is grapevine surgery, where the grapevine trunk is cut open using a chainsaw. Another smaller chainsaw is used to clean the trunk by removing dead/infected wood, leaving the trunk open to dry</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Grapes leaf blight
        <li>Northern grapes leaf blight is favoured by wet humid cool weather typically found later in the growing season. Spores of the fungus that causes this disease can be transported by wind long distances from infected fields. Spread within and between fields locally also relies on wind blown spores.</li>

    </ul>
